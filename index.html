            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello, my name is James Davin, and I am a current intern at The MathWorks, the creators of MATLAB, and a student at Boston University pursuing my B.A. in Statistics & Computer Science graduating Fall 2024. My skills include strong algorithmic, coding, analytical thinking, and writing abilities. I am comfortable in Java, JavaScript, Python, Go, and numerous data science and statistical packages including R, NumPy, PyTorch and more. I have a strong aptitude for challenge and growth, and I am always looking to learn new skills and acquire new knowledge. If you'd like to learn more, visit my personal website at jamesdavin.me. (Please note that this website (aljarida.github.io) is not a replacement for my personal website but rather a required project of a course at BU.)</p>
